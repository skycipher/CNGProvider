Rule Name:

    IoctlReqs

Domain:

    wdf

Rule ID:

    Not Applicable

Description:

    This rule verifies that IOCTL requests are not passed to 
    inappropriate KMDF request send DDIs.
    
    Rule diagnostics:
    All requests presented to the driver in the EVT_WDF_IO_QUEUE_IO_DEVICE_CONTROL
    callback are guaranteed to be IOCTL requests. Hence these cannot be sent using
    DDIs that are specific to sending read, write, ioctl, etc requests.
